                        Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said Indian scientists have done their duty by developing
                        the COVID-19 vaccine and “now we have to fulfil ours” by defeating through the right information
                        every network spreading lies and rumours.

                        An Indian cricket team saddled with broken bones and battered bodies showed a never-seen-before
                        zeal to retain the coveted Border-Gavaskar trophy with a historic three-wicket win over
                        Australia in the fourth and final Test here, successfully chasing a 328-run target to seal the
                        four-match series 2-1.

                        Movies such as Bawarchi and Nauker extol the virtues of serving one’s master—they also serve who
                        stand and wait or work themselves to the bone.</p>
